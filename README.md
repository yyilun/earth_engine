# Sample code for Google Earth Engine written in Javascript

Yilun Ying, 2017

I was a research assistant for a Columbia-Harvard joint project on the impact of the Haze Crisis on South East Asia. 
My main job was to code in Google Earth Engine to visualize and analyze geo-spatial satellite data.

This is a sample code that visualized the forest loss over a time period and individual years.
